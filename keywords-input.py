# Rules for identifiers(same for variable)
# An identifier is the name u give to any user defined element in programming(variable, function, class, object)
# 1 can only start with an alphabet or _
# 2 Followed by 0 or more letters, _ and digits.
# 3 Keywords cannot be used as an identifier.
# input("Naam batao : ")

# first_num = input("Enter the first number: ")
# second_num = input("Enter the second number: ")

# print(first_num)
# print(second_num)
# print(first_num + second_num)

# result = first_num + second_num
# print(result)

print(4+5.5)
int(4.5) # converts into integer datatype
print (int('45'))
print (str(5)) # will converts into a string
bool(1) # will convert into bool
complex(4) # will converts into complex
list("Hello") # will converts into list
# Type conversion is not a permanant operation but type casting is....

a = 4.5
int(a)
print(a)

first_num = input("Enter the first number: ")
second_num = input("Enter the second number: ")

result = int(first_num) + int(second_num)
print(result)

# better way to do addition

firstnum = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
secondnum = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

result = firstnum+secondnum

# explicit conversion : We have to do conversion by our own.
